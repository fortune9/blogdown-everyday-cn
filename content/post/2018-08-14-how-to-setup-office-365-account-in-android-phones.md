When you got a new android phone, you usually set it up
to get emails and synchronize calendars from your online
accounts. Today, I demonstrate the steps for an office365
account. The steps should be similar for all android phones, including Samsung, Google Pixel, Huawei, etc.

1. Find the "Accounts" setting page in the phone, which
is usually immediately under "Settings", and may have
name variations such as "Accounts & Sync" or "Users & accounts". Tap the item to enter the accounts setting page.

2. Then tap 'Add account'.

3. Choose "Exchange" (not 'Corporate' or 'Personal(IMAP)')
to add the account.

4. On next pages, input your email address (e.g., abc@example.com) and password and keep others as default. Then tap 'Continue' or 'Next'.

5. On the following page, ensure that your **full email** (e.g., abc@example.com) is at the field of "Domain\\Username" or "Username" (in the second case, keep the 'Domain' field blank if separately present) and "SSL/TLS" in the field of 'Security type'. And put 'outlook.office365.com' at the field 'Server'. Then tap to continue.

6. Once the account is verified, it may prompt a message of "Remote Security administration" for remote control of
your device by office 365. Tap 'OK' to continue. Finally,
click 'Activate' to activate the setup account on your phone.

7. Finally, you can do further settings for the account
such as sync frequency and date range among others.

## Key notes

I would like to point out that in addition to choosing
'Exchange' at Step 3, one may also choose 'Corporate';
if so, the default email app, instead of Gmail, will be
used for synchronizing emails. 

Also, if one only want to synchronize emails, but not
contacts nor calendars, he can choose 'Personal(IMAP)'
at Step 3.

For these two alternative options, the other settings
are similar with slight variations in steps.

I hope the information helps. Enjoy your phone. :smile:
